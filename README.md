# Hydra
## PSU Evil League of Evil: Fall 2023 Challenge
Hydra is a three-headed cybersecurity challenge: can you prevail?

Here you'll find the materials for each of the three challenges: 
- [[REDACTED]](https://github.com/ethanpinter/hydra/tree/main/Challenge%20A%20-%20%5BREDACTED%5D), by [@ethanpinter](https://github.com/ethanpinter)
- [Onion](https://github.com/ethanpinter/hydra/tree/main/Challenge%20B%20-%20Onion), by [@asareynolds](https://github.com/asareynolds)
- [Carrot](https://github.com/ethanpinter/hydra/tree/main/Challenge%20C%20-%20Carrot), by [@sheriffCy](https://github.com/sheriffCy)


To defeat each of Hydra's heads, you must find a flag in the format "flag{NOT_THAT_EASY}". Submit the flags [here](placeholder.example.com) for entry to the League.
